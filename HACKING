Build from bzr branch
---------------------
 $ ./bootstrap
 $ ./configure

Use `./configure --help' for options. Use `--prefix' to make an install in
your home directory. This is necessary to test python scripts.

 $ make

The main redshift program can be run at this point. To test python
scripts run:

 $ make install


Notes
-----
- verbose flag is (currently) only held in redshift.c; thus, write all
  verbose messages there.
